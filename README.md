### Projects
**Trends in American's Beliefs about Fluoride from Twitter**
- Conducted in-depth analysis of public sentiment regarding water fluoridation. Employing advanced techniques to extract 80,000 relevant tweets leveraging a Web Scraping tool via Digital Ocean VPC.
- Collected a subset of 1000 tweets for manual labeling; Later used for fine tuning a Transformer model (RoBERTa).
- Created a ML Pipeline to pre process the data, normalize and remove unnecessary tweets for finetuning the transformer model.
- Analyzed the sentiment of 40,000+ tweets with the Fine-Tuned RoBERTa model, enabling effective predictions on a large volume of unlabeled data.
- Developed correlation matrices by clustering topics derived from unstructured data sources.

**Size Profile Optimization**
- Forecasting size level demand at each store for any set of store-option pair.
- Using AI/ML methodologies to determine true demand and optimize inventory.
- The forecast was created by consuming BI reports and SQL dumps.
- A decision tree regressor was trained on historical sales data to understand trends and predict future sales.
- A frontend was developed using Streamlit to host the deployed model. 

**Stock price prediction using past stock prices and tweets**
- Collected more than 5 years worth of stoick prices for the Alphabet stock ticker. Conducted predictive analysis on historical stock prices and public sentiment data to project future stock prices.
- Explored and evaluated the performance of 9 different Machine Learning models and three word embedding techniques, namely TF-IDF and "Bag of Words" for analysis.
- Implemented a data pipeline for daily Twitter data processing, normalization, and sentiment analysis.
- Identified "Bag of Words" as the optimal word embedding model and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) as the most effective classifier.

**Ensemble Machine Learning Model for sentiment analysis**
- Developed an ensemble Machine Learning model by combining two Deep Leaning models with TensorFlow and OpenAI; Utilized SpaCy and NLTK libraries to prepare the extracted data for seamless model training.
- Utilized Digital Ocean VPCs to establish connections with multiple data centers worldwide, allowing for the simultaneous extraction of terabytes of tweets for data acquisition.
- Orchestrated a robust data pipeline utilizing SpaCy and NLTK libraries to preprocess and prepare the extracted data for seamless model training.
- Evaluated the model with Accuracy, MCC Coefficient and other ML metrics to reveal an impressive accuracy of 77% for ensemble model, while the existing state-of-the-art model achieved approximately 85%.

**Data Mining and Machine Learning - Portfolio**
- Implemented various NLP techniques such as Naive Bayes, k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, decision trees, and linear classifiers, all evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation approach.
- Employed a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, including Accuracy, F-Score, ROC/AUC curve, precision, and recall, to assess the effectiveness of each model.
